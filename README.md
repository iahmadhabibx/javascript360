Returning a new array formed by applying the mixture of map() followed by a flat() of depth 1 (arr.map(...args).flat()), but slightly more efficient than calling those two methods separately.
# Day - 41:
Creating threads in NodeJS/Javascript to concurrently run computations in the background.
# Day - 42:
Creating an alias for your deconstructed key.

# Day - 43:
A custom sort by function which accepts a 2nd parameter which defines by what key you want to sort.

# Day - 44:
A simple implementation of a debounce function, which is used to throttle repeated function calls, ensuring that the function is only executed after a specified delay once the calls have stopped coming in.
# Day - 45:
In this snippet, the curry function takes another function fn as an argument and returns a new curried function. The curried function is capable of handling partial application by accepting arguments one by one and returning new functions until all required arguments are provided.
# Day - 46:
implementation of a "debounce" function using the latest ECMAScript features, including Promise and async/await. The debounce function ensures that the given function is only executed once after a specified delay, even if it's called multiple times within that delay.
# Day - 47:
Using memoization, the fibonacci function's costly recursive calls are optimized, and subsequent calls with the same arguments are retrieved from the cache, avoiding redundant computations.
